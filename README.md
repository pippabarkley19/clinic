Welcome to my clinic project repository!
This project was part of my SENG 265 course during the fall of 2024.
This was the first opportunity I had to combine my programming skills into creating a relatively simple software.
Just the prospect of this project, and having a chance to showcase my skills, was very exciting.
Here you will find the 3 different stages of the clinic software being completed.

- A3 contains just the bare bones of the software: the classes that build the system. It utilizes in-memory data storage, as persistence has yet to be addressed.

- A4 contains the base classes along with file-based persistence (JSON and Pickle) via a Data Access Object (DAO) pattern

- A5 contains the final product: all of the above, as well as the GUI developed using PyQt6

Although a simple project, an excellent way to enter the world of software design. Also, this project gave me the opportunity to master Git resources, which was just as crucial to my education as the actual software development.
